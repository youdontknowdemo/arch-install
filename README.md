# arch-linux-base-setup

## **Most of the post-install/setup script (setup.sh/arch-lbs-devel.sh) will run from the user account that is well qalified and promoted as such**

### IF you have your own baiic arch linux install, run that first and then RUN:

```sh
curl --tlsv1.2 -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YurinDoctrine/arch-linux-base-setup/main/arch-linux-base-setup.sh >arch-lbs-devel.sh && \
 chmod 0755 arch-lbs-devel.sh && \
 ./arch-lbs-devel.sh

```

## **OR**

### If you want to install from your live archiso USB key or CD, and you would like to use my forked base install RUN:

```

```
